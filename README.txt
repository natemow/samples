================================
drupal
================================
  A few custom modules I've recently built for Drupal. Some background on the
  imis_isgweb mod is available at http://www.interactivestrategies.com/blog/drupalorg-contribution-imis-isgweb-module.
  The scoutscoop_itinerary mod was part of the scoutscoop.com project described
  in my resume...the supporting JS is also available for review in the jquery
  directory.


================================
jquery
================================
  I typically establish a single application.js for each new project that taps
  any linked frameworks, libraries, plugins, etc. The instances you see here
  represent Google Maps v3 integration, some custom animations, and a bit of
  AJAX processing via jQuery. I've worked with Prototype, Dojo, MooTools and
  YUI as well, but jQuery is definitely my favorite.


================================
custom
================================
  This is the bootstrap class I wrote for a custom OO, hook-based framework
  I've been working on in my spare time. The project was inspired by some of
  the more elegant functionality I've run across in both the Drupal and Kohana
  cores. Overall, my goal is to create something with a much smaller code
  footprint and a shorter ramp-up time for both themers and mod developers.
  This code is far from production-ready, but eventually I'd like to get it
  in to a publicly available Git repo, put together a small brochure/demo site
  and see if it gains any traction out in the wild.


================================
css
================================
This is the main stylesheet that I wrote for infinityqs.com.


================================
tsql
================================
  Here are some stored procedures that I wrote to support the PBS ROI dashboard
  application. The idea here was to replicate the same formulas that were
  present in their FileMaker Pro db, which I had to first convert to MSSQL
  RDBMS format.


================================
cs
================================
  Some good examples of my .NET C# days; this is a smattering of code from
  various projects that illustrate OOP concepts, some WinForms dev, LDAP
  integration, etc. Some of these samples are outdated based on functionality
  available in newer versions of the .NET framework, but at the time this was
  pretty useful stuff.


================================
docs
================================
  A snapshot of reports and briefs I did when my own small dev/design agency
  (10 Notes) was still active; oodles more of the same available if you're
  interested.
